# TRIVY - A Simple Fun Trivia Game

### What Is Trivy?

### Technologies Used
In order to get Trivia questions, I used the Open Trivia Database API. This API has multiple Trivia questions spanning many categories. I also tried to used a separate API for the speed round in case the Open Trivia API went down.

### Approach
I began by trying to replicate Trivia Crack by making a 2 player game board and have a roulette wheel spin to tell you which category you land on.

### Future Features
I want to finish fleshing out the speed round. Right now no matter if your answer matches the correct answer, it says you are wrong. I would also like to add multiplayer functionality to the Classic version of the game.

### Bugs

### Biggest Wins and Challenges


The game you chose.
The rules of the game.
Your process for turning that game into a web application (wireframes, blockers/issues that popped up).
